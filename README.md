# Rutgers ECE Notes

This repository contains some markdown files holding notes relevant to introductory Rutgers ECE classes (PEE1, DLD, PEE2, etc.)

The `web` directory contains code for a [basic circuit markup website](https://ecenotes.pmpuns.dev) that I made. It contains several tech demos showing off basic circuit components and behaviour. There is, as of yet, no support for circuit simulation. It is also mildly buggy, given that I made it in literally a week for an assignment for DLD.

All of the code was written by Eric Yang, alias periodically-makes-puns, or pmpuns. I can be found on Discord at `@pmpuns`.
