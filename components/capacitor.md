# Capacitor

Capacitors store energy in the form of an electric field.

Capacitors behave according to the following relation:

Q(t) = CV(t).

Alternatively, this can be differentiated to obtain

I(t) = C*dV(t)/dt.

The energy stored in a capacitor is:

E(t) = /int P(t) dt = /int V(t)I(t) dt = /int CV dV(t)/dt dt = 1/2*CV^2
