# Passive Sign Convention

Passive Sign Convention tells us which direction of current flow is considered positive current.

Define a positive and negative terminal. 

Current is considered positive when it is flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.

As a result, power is positive when the component is dissipating power, and negative when the component is providing power.

EX: Resistors always have a positive power dissipation, even if the "negative" terminal has a higher voltage.
